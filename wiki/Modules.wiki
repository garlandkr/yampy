Download the needed modules from [http://pypi.python.org/pypi PyPi] or use easy_install from setuptools.

These are built-in modules, they should come packaged with your Python:
*logging, shutil, pickle, urllib, re*

These are completely seperate and will need to be installed individually:
*imdb, sqlalchemy*
