Download the needed modules from [PyPi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi) or use easy\_install from setuptools.

These are built-in modules, they should come packaged with your Python:
**logging, shutil, pickle, urllib, re**

These are completely seperate and will need to be installed individually:
**imdb, sqlalchemy**
